Workflow:

Step 1: Input Configuration

.env: Contains non-sensitive configuration, such as baseUrl.

requirements.xlsx: Contains the business requirements and user journey steps that will be parsed into test scenarios.

Step 2: User Journey Creation

Parse the requirements.xlsx to extract user journeys and acceptance criteria.

Generate user journeys in a structured markdown format (user-journeys.md) from the input Excel file.

Step 3: BDD Artifacts Generation

Feature files (.feature) are generated using the Gherkin syntax based on the user journey.

Step definition files (.steps.ts) are created to implement the Given/When/Then steps using Playwright commands.

Page objects (.page.ts) are created for reusable page interaction logic.

Step 4: Test Execution

Execute tests using Playwright's npm test command.

If tests fail, apply self-healing by running discovery tests, identifying real selectors, and fixing the issues.

Step 5: Post-Execution Actions

Re-run all tests after applying fixes to ensure all tests pass.

Generate reports (HTML, JSON, JUnit) with Playwright’s built-in reporting functionality.

Step 6: Final Documentation

Test execution summary: A summary of test results (pass/fail, scenarios executed).

Generate README.md: Document the entire testing setup, instructions, and any specific configurations used.
