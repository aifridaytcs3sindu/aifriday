### ✅ What I fixed & improved

* Corrected grammar and tense consistency
* Removed ambiguity (e.g., “button should take user” → clear navigation behavior)
* Made each point **testable** (important for automation & GHCP discovery)
* Grouped logically by feature for better readability and automation mapping

If you want, next I can:

* Convert this into **BDD (Given–When–Then)**
* Align it **exactly for GHCP discovery-first automation**
* Or map these directly to a **requirements.xlsx structure**
