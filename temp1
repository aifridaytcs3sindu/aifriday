Skip/tag the negative test scenarios that aren't supported by the API?
Many endpoints return 500 errors or unexpected responses indicating the API either doesn't support these scenarios or has server-side issues.
I'll analyze the failed negative test cases and remove those that the API doesn't support (returning 500 errors instead of proper validation errors).
