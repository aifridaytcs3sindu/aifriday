Approach: Dependency Management in an automated way assisted by AI with human in the loop

Usage of GitHub Copilot aims to reduce the effort taken by teams to fix the Snyk vulnerabilities which involves changes to the respective dependency files, source code, build and unit test of applications.

Refined Prompt to GitHub Copilot Chat inside IDE in Agentic mode giving clear direction to identify all vulnerabilities using Snyk CLI and to enable safe fixes, without changes to functionality.

Prompt would direct on the actions from GHCP based on the type of Java, Spring boot versions in the Repo

The prompt also would give clear indication on re-executing Snyk CLI after the fixes as well as taking care of Build and unit testing.

 

Pre-requisites

Active GitHub Copilot Business License

Snyk CLI setup in machine and authenticated

Current and latest version of Java available (Java 11, 17, 21)

Multiple Java version path setup available (Pre and Post migration) - Windows

 

Series of activities executed by GitHub Copilot

Build the Application and ensure it is successful. Incase of Failure, the process stops

Run Snyk CLI to get Baseline Vulnerability Report with list of current vulnerabilities.

Verify the version of Java. Progressively migrate to Java (11 → 17 → 21) as needed.

Once upgraded to Java 21, migrate to Spring Boot parent to latest 3.5.x

Run Maven build/tests and fix any failures.

Scan repo with Snyk CLI and save output to a JSON file.

Parse JSON to extract dependency, version, severity, and issue type.

Update dependency file with recommended versions for each fixable issue.

Re-run Snyk scan to check remaining vulnerabilities.

Repeat fix-scan loop until no Critical or High vulnerabilities remain.

Commit changes and raise PR.

 

Observations

VScode + GHCP had more features compared to IntelliJ + GHCP.

In machines with special access, like Admin access - the execution was seamless.

Sometimes in IntelliJ, GHCP was not picking up the errors from terminal, had to explicitly copy the error in GHCP chat to get the issue fixed.

For Same Repo, same prompt, same IDE - the processes followed by GHCP and the steps taken were different. For instance, there were cases where test case migration did not happen and few of the high snyk issues were open after the run. 

Based on the system prompt provided, GHCP creates a To Do List with step by step processes to fulfil user requirement/achieve the goal.

In General, close to 90% of Snyk Critical and High vulnerabilities were addressed in the first run itself.

End of the day the output from GHCP, to be reviewed thoroughly by seniors in team before merging the PR.
