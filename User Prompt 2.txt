ðŸ“˜ **User Prompt â€” Generate Swagger API Regression Tests**

Generate **Playwright + Cucumber API test scripts** for the `/store` endpoint from the **Petstore Swagger API**:  
ðŸ”— https://petstore.swagger.io/#/store

Please strictly follow the architectural and coding standards defined in the `.copilot-instructions` file at the project root.

### **Details**
- **Swagger API URL:** https://petstore.swagger.io/#/store  
- **Target Endpoint:** `/store`  
- **Operations to Cover:** `POST`, `GET`, `DELETE` (include `PUT` if available)  
- **Tech Stack:** Playwright (for APIRequestContext) + Cucumber.js + Chai assertions  
- **Goal:**  
  Generate all necessary files (feature, step definitions, API client helper, config) and ensure the tests execute and pass **without any manual intervention**.

---

### **Expected Output**
1. **Feature Files:** Readable Gherkin scenarios covering CRUD flows.  
2. **Step Definitions:** Implemented using Playwrightâ€™s request context and helper functions.  
3. **API Client Helper:** File handling API calls and schema-based payloads.  
4. **Configuration:** Complete `package.json` setup with scripts (`npm test`, `npm run test:api`).  
5. **Execution Verification:** Ensure `npm run test:api` runs successfully.

### **Execution Behavior**
- After generation, run all tests automatically.  
- If any failure occurs, debug and fix automatically.  
- Retry until all tests pass successfully.  

---

### âœ… **Completion Criteria**
All regression test scenarios for the specified Swagger endpoint must:
- Execute successfully.  
- Pass validation for status codes, payloads, and schema fields.  
- Log meaningful console output.  
- Require zero manual intervention.
