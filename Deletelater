### 2.2 Conditional Negative Test Scenarios Based on HTTP Methods

For each API operation (e.g., `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`), the system must generate **negative test cases** based on the endpoint's HTTP method. Some endpoints may not support specific error codes like `400`, `401`, or `500` for certain HTTP methods. 

For instance:

- **GET requests** typically do not support `400 Bad Request` or `401 Unauthorized` as they are designed to retrieve data, not to modify it.
- **POST requests** may support all error codes, including `400`, `401`, `404`, and `500`.
- **PUT and DELETE requests** are more likely to support `400`, `404`, and `500` error codes when resources are missing or the payload is invalid.

#### Rules:
- **GET**: Avoid generating `400` or `401` errors. Focus on `404` (not found) and `500` (server error).
- **POST**: Generate all four errors: `400`, `401`, `404`, and `500`.
- **PUT**: Generate `400`, `404`, and `500` errors.
- **DELETE**: Generate `400`, `404`, and `500` errors.

This should be incorporated into the feature file generation, ensuring that error scenarios align with the correct HTTP method's capabilities.

**Example:**

For a `GET` endpoint, only `404` and `500` error scenarios will be generated, while for a `POST` endpoint, all four errors (`400`, `401`, `404`, `500`) will be included.

```gherkin
# Example for GET endpoint
@not-found
Scenario: Fetch a non-existent resource should return 404
  Given I request a GET for a non-existent resource
  When I send the request
  Then the response status should be 404
  And the error message should mention "not found"

@server-error
Scenario: Internal server error on GET request should return 500
  Given I request a GET for a valid resource that triggers a server error
  When I send the request
  Then the response status should be 500
  And the error message should mention "internal server error"

# Example for POST endpoint
@bad-request
Scenario: Create resource with invalid data should return 400
  Given I have an invalid resource payload
  When I send a POST request to create the resource
  Then the response status should be 400
  And the error message should mention "invalid"

@unauthorized
Scenario: Create resource with invalid authentication should return 401
  Given I have an invalid authentication token
  When I send a POST request to create the resource
  Then the response status should be 401
  And the error message should mention "unauthorized"

@not-found
Scenario: Create resource with non-existent reference should return 404
  Given I have a reference to a non-existent resource
  When I send a POST request to create the resource
  Then the response status should be 404
  And the error message should mention "not found"

@server-error
Scenario: Create resource with invalid server-side logic should return 500
  Given I send a request that triggers a server-side failure
  When I send the POST request
  Then the response status should be 500
  And the error message should mention "server error"
