🧭 1. Overview

Objective

This document explains the API Automation built using Playwright and Cucumber.js, designed to automate API endpoint validation from Swagger definitions.

Key Technologies

🧩 Playwright – Handles API calls and assertions.

🧠 Cucumber.js – Enables Behavior-Driven (BDD) test design.

✅ Chai – Assertion library for validating responses.

🤖 GitHub Copilot + GHCP – Auto-generates and self-heals test code using AI.

Purpose

To create an AI-assisted, self-healing, and retry-enabled API automation suite that runs against Swagger-defined endpoints with zero manual intervention.

⚙️ 2. Prerequisites

Before running the framework, ensure the following prerequisites:

Active GitHub Copilot Business License

Node.js (v18+) and npm

Playwright + Cucumber.js installed

Swagger API JSON URL or local Swagger JSON file

💻 Supported IDEs

The framework is compatible with both:

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) — Primary IDE used in this POC

IntelliJ IDEA — Tested successfully for JetBrains users

Both IDEs integrate seamlessly with GitHub Copilot Chat and GHCP (GitHub Copilot CLI).

🧩 3. Process Flow Diagram

[Swagger JSON File/URL] --> [Copilot Prompt Processing] → [Test Generation (Feature + Step Definitions + Supporting files)] --> [Test Execution (Playwright + Cucumber)] --> [Test Result Validation] --> [Retry & Self-Healing Mechanism] --> [Reports (HTML / JSON)]

Diagram Explanation:
The process starts with parsing the Swagger JSON, generating tests automatically, executing them using Playwright, applying retries/self-healing when failures occur, and producing detailed reports.

🚀 4. Approach & Execution Steps

📘 Swagger JSON-Driven Test Generation

Example URL: https://example.com/swagger.json
Example Local File: /api/salesOrderApi.json

The framework accepts either a remote Swagger URL or a local JSON file and automatically extracts API endpoints, HTTP methods, and schemas.

🔄 Execution Flow

Parse Swagger JSON Definition

Extract endpoints, methods (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE), request/response schemas, and authentication rules.

Auto-Generate Test Suite

Creates BDD-style feature files and corresponding step definitions with positive and negative test scenarios.

Execute Tests

Runs tests automatically, logging detailed info about requests, responses, and errors.

Self-Healing & Retry

If a test fails, the framework auto-fixes payloads or request parameters and retries up to 3 times.

Reporting

Generates both HTML and JSON reports under /reports/, including stack traces and validation logs.

📂 5. Detailed Execution Flow

Swagger JSON Handling

Supports both remote and local Swagger JSONs.

Automatically detects:

Base path

Endpoints

Request/response definitions

Authentication method (Basic/Bearer)

Scenario Generation

Each endpoint generates:

Positive Test (200)

Negative Tests based on HTTP method rules:

Retry & Self-Healing Logic

Automatically retries failed steps up to 3 times.

Rebuilds payloads or assertions dynamically.

Stops execution only after all scenarios pass.

🔍 6. Observations & Key Findings

Swagger JSON Handling

The framework dynamically parses the Swagger JSON (local or remote) and auto-generates test cases for each endpoint.

IDE Insights

VS Code offered better Copilot integration and smoother GHCP prompt execution.

IntelliJ IDEA was also supported, though certain auto-fixes required manual confirmation.

🧪 7. Sample Test Case



@order @create
Scenario: Successfully place a new order
  Given I have a valid order payload
  When I send a POST request to /orders with the payload
  Then the response status should be 201
  And the response body should contain the order ID
Note: Each test is self-contained and automatically retries until successful execution.

🏁 8. Conclusion

This POC showcases how Playwright + Cucumber + GitHub Copilot can automate API testing using Swagger JSON definitions with minimal human effort.

The self-healing and retry-enabled architecture ensures reliable, repeatable regression testing that adapts dynamically to API changes.
